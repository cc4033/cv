Hey there! I'm Chester and I'm awesome just like you.

Meditation, diet, and exercise are my foundation that allow me to fully enjoy my hobbies of playing soccer and basketball, reading, and hanging out with my friends. I love to cook and eat a whole food, plant based diet, and I am very thankful that I discovered it because of the changes that I see in my life.

I love my family in MD, VA, and MA. Same goes for my friends in Houston, from MIT, and from high school in Columbia.

If you find yourself on this page, I hope we can connect on something in common. Peace!
